                <br>
                The game of table tennis is played on a flat table that has a net between two courts. 
                The participants hold little bats that push the lightweight hollow ball back and forth across the net. 
                It's a fast-moving sport that calls for excellent hand-eye coordination and quick reflexes.
                The objective of standard play is to get the ball back onto your opponent's side of the table, letting it bounce once on your end before striking it with your racket. If your opponent is unable to bring the ball back to your side of the table, you score a point.
                Players must alternate shots when playing table tennis as doubles.
